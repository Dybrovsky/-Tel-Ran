// Task 1

// You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N
//  where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.
// 	For example:
// Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:Your function will return the index 3, 
// because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.
